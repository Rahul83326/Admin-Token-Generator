# firebase-admin-sdk-user-management
Firebase Admin SDK RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js to bridge between the connection using RESTful client.

I built this API to bridge between Firebase Admin SDK for managing Firebase Authentication Users via RESTful client, due to the extended
capability of Node.js version of the SDK (other than managing Storage and Realtime Database).
